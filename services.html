                    <p>
                        At AHYDTECH Geomorphic, we are able to produce various tools to manage
                        stormwater flow for development applications. These tools include floodplain
                        mapping, flood hazard analysis, water quality monitoring and other various
                        stormwater management applications.

                <h3>Topography and Bathymetry Surveying</h3>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        AHYDTECH Geomorphic has professional civil engineer (P. Eng.) who can
                        perform topography and bathymetry survey. Our surveying staff members
                        have experience in completing cross-section and topographic survey for
                        natural channel design, channel restoration and stream stabilization, coastal
                        engineering structure inspection, and channel/shoreline
                        restoration/naturalization purposes. We use Drone DJI Phantom 4 RTK + D-
                        RTK, GPS and GNSS unite and Nikon DTM-322 total station to perform
                        survey. AHYDECH has Lowrance Elite-4 CHIRP and HY1500 Digital Echo
                        Sounder bathymetric survey unit, which has a recording sonar to measure
                        depth and GPS to provide geo-reference coordinates.

                <h3>Automated Bathymetry – Unmanned Surface Vessel</h3>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        AHYDTECH has an Unmanned Surveying Vehicle (USV) for measurement of
                        bathymetry using HY1500 Digital Echo Sounder bathymetric survey unit. It
                        uses an onboard computer, GPS/RTK, depth sounder and other instruments.
                        The boat’s powerful outdrives are capable of reaching speed up to 3m/s and
                        efficient V-bottom design produces smooth, predictable, agile handling even
                        rough waters. The 2 electric propellers provide thrust while producing little
                        noise, this improve the quality of the acoustic sounders data. Its remote-
                        control range is about 2km. The USV has 4-hour battery life. When used with
                        a land based computer, it has the Hydra-II software for automated guidance
                        and route planning.
