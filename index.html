					<h3>Hydrologic Modeling</h3>
					<div>
						<p>
							The hydrologic cycle and hydrologic responses of watershed, subwatershed or catchment can be simulated by hydrologic models. The models are applied for hydrologic prediction and for understanding hydrologic processes. There are two major types hydrolgic models: Stochastic Model and Physical-based or Deterministic Model. the deterministic hydrology models can be subdivided into single-event models and continuous simulation models; they provide representation of surface runoff, interflow, infiltration, groundwater recharge, gorundwater flow, evapotranspiration and stream flow. AHYDTECH has resources to provide innovative techniques and solutions through applying hydrologic models to make better predictions and to face the major challenges in water resources management.
						</p>
					</div>
