                    <p>
                        Coastal Engineering is the branch of civil engineering, which involves the
                        processes ongoing at the shoreline, design and construction within the coastal zone. The
                        hydrodynamic impacts of waves, wind-waves, tides, storm surge and tsunamis on the shoreline and
                        near coastal zone are integral parts of the coastal engineering study. AHYDTECH senior coastal
                        engineer has experience in Shoreline Management, Permit and Approval from the regulating
                        agencies, determination of Erosion and Flooding Hazard Limits, Shoreline Erosion Protection,
                        preparation of Shoreline Structure Inventory, design of Seawall, Breakwall, Revetment and Groin,
                        Marina Structure, and the implementation of waterfront projects including 2D and 3D hydrodynamic
                        and sediment transport modelling using XBEACH, ADCIRC &amp; TUFLOW software.

                            <p>
                                When building of a new or an extension of coastal property, it is necessary to
                                assess erosion and flooding potential. Regulating Agency (Conservation
                                Authority) requires erosion and flooding hazard lines be delineated to ensure
                                safety of life and property. The MNRF needs yearly erosion rates and slope
                                stability to be accounted for in the delineation. Wave uprush prediction is
                                conducted to assess the site specific flood potential. AHYDTECH staff
                                conduct topographic and geomorphic assessment to ensure accurate
                                delineation of the hazard limits. Any planned extension cannot be built beyond
                                this line, it is best to have a line created before having building plans drawn.

                        <div>
                            <p>
                                Natural Channel Design (NCD) involves techniques to restore or replicate
                                fluvial geomorphic forms, functions and processes of a stream channel
                                through field geomorphic assessment, conceptual design and detail design.
                                NCD is the application of fluvial geomorphology to design and construct stable
                                channels that do not aggrade or degrade over time. This will maximize stream
                                functions given site constraints, which supports aquatic and riparian
                                ecosystems of composition and quality. NCD uses hydrology, hydraulic and
                                fluvial geomorphic responses, bankfull and/or reference reach parameters to
                                determine design parameters through utilizing complex and inter-related
                                processes of aquatic and riparian ecosystem. The AHYDTECH staff
                                possesses a broad knowledge and extensive experience in conceptual and
                                detail design of natural channel system.

                                Rivers and streams have natural fluvial processes to migrate in lateral and
                                longitudinal directions. The Meander Belt Width Assessment is a technique for
                                planning and determining hazard limits for managing the risk of life and
                                property due to river erosion and migration. The meander belt assessment
                                includes reach delineation, planform determination and meandering geometry
                                assessment. This technique is applied in Subwatershed Studies, SWM
                                Development Limit studies, Watercourse Re-naturalization, Bridge/Culvert
                                Replacement and Installation and Municipal Infrastructure Installation
                                applications. If historic aerial photographs are available, the 100-year
                                migration rate is determined to estimate the erosion setback. AHYDTECH has
                                extensive experience in Mender Belt width and Erosion Hazard Limit
                                Assessment in the southern Ontario.

                                The channel restoration process applies channel stability, dimensions,
                                patterns, profile and biological and aquatic considerations to restore a stream,
                                which will provide stable and natural fluvial process in the stream.
                                Geomorphological, hydraulic and ecological degraded streams can all have
                                an appropriate management solution through stream restoration. Restoration

                                landform, land use, geological features, floodplain, channel dimensions,
                                sediment sizes, bed forms, and slope. Rapid field assessments (RGA, RSAT)
                                are qualitative techniques based on the presence and/or the absence of key
                                indicators of channel instability, and ecological health and function of a
                                stream. These techniques are applied to understand the existing geomorphic
                                conditions and to do detail geomorphic assessment. Field data collection also
                                includes topographic survey, stream erosion measurement and flow
                                monitoring. AHYDTECH employees possess experience in stream field data
