                        AHYDTECH Water Resources (BD) Ltd. is a sister organization in Bangladesh
                        working in water resources, river morphology, hydrology and hydraulic. We
                        are working on all the rivers and river systems of Bangladesh including the
                        Padma, Meghna and Brahmaputra-Jamuna basins. We have been developing
                        HEC-HMS hydrological models for the three major basins – Ganges
                        (1,087,300 Km 2 ), Brahmaputra-Jamuna (552,000 Km 2 ), and Meghna (82,000
                        Km 2 ). These three basins together are one of the largest river basin systems
                        of the world. The HEC-HMS models are being calibrated using observed flow
                        data. The calibrated models will be used to simulate flows at subbasin outlets
                        for water resources management, river dredging analysis, river morphology
                        and bank erosion assessment, hydraulic and sediment transport analysis,
                        natural channel design and river training.

                        Padma, Meghna and Brahmaputra-Jamuna basins. The company is
                        developing hydraulic models of the three major rivers (Padma River, Jamuna
                        River, and Meghna River) in Bangladesh. We have developed a 2D Hydraulic
                        Model of the Jamuna River, one of the largest braided river in the world. The
                        2D Hydraulic model is 230 km long, which extends from Kurigram to the
                        Padma River confluence. The model can be used for Water Resources
                        Management, Flood Remediation, River Training and Dredging, and River
                        Morphology and Bank Erosion Assessment. AHYDTECH has also created a
                        conceptual Natural Channel &amp; River Training Design of 160 Km long the
                        Jamuna River from Gaibandha to the Padma River confluence. We have
                        developed 2D Hydraulic and 2D sediment Transport models for preparing and
                        assessing the Jamuna River Natural Channel Design.

                        numerous coastal engineering projects. These projects include shoreline
                        management, shoreline erosion protection, marina design and implementation
                        of waterfront. The company has experience in following types of coastal
                        engineering projects: Shoreline Inventory, Shoreline Structural Condition
                        Assessment, Bathymetry Data Collection, 2D and 3D hydrodynamic,

                        Quality Modeling and Analysis. We apply estuarine and coastal processes
                        including hydrodynamics, wind-wave actions, wave transformation, refraction,
                        diffraction, shoaling, and breaking waves for understanding, analyzing, and
                        designing for our coastal engineering projects. AHYDTECH provides planning
                        and design services, construction supervision and administration including
                        tidal marsh restoration, bio-engineered and breakwater structure design

                        AHYDTECH has extensive experience in hydrologic modeling. The company’s
                        engineers have developed stochastic and deterministic models including
                        lumped and physically distributed hydrologic models for aids in understanding,
                        predicting, and managing water resources. We have used HEC-HMS,
                        SWMHYMO, PCSWMM, SWMM, HSP-F, GAWSER, MIKE SHE, MIKE 11
                        NAM, &amp; VISUAL OTTHYMO software to develop single rainfall event and
                        continuous models. The hydrologic models are calibrated using observed flow
                        data. The models use precipitation, temperature, soil, surficial geology,
                        landuse/land cover and evapotranspiration data, reservoir/dam storage-
                        discharge-volume rating curves, and IDF curves.

                        AHYDTECH engineers have extensive experience in hydraulic and sediment
                        transport modeling. AHYDTECH developed numerous 1D/2D Hydraulic,
                        Water Quality and Sediment Transport models. AHYDTECH senior engineer
                        developed a 2D hydrodynamic code in FORTRAN to study the “Cohesive
                        River Bank Erosion Mechanism”. The model was calibrated using measured
                        flow data. AHYDTECH develop hydraulic models to determine the aerial
                        extents and inundation depths of flooding. Senior Engineer Dr. Bahar SM is
                        the lead for development of hydraulic model. AHYDTECH use 1D Hydraulic
                        Model using several software (HEC-RAS, PCSWMM, SWMM5, SWMM, MIKE
                        11) and 2D Hydraulic Model (SRH-2D, 2D HEC-RAS 5, RMA2, FESWMS,
                        TUFLOW, STWAVE, ADCIRC, MIKE 21). We do floodplain characterization
                        and comment on the degree of flood risk under the various return period
                        events (5, 25, 50, 100 and 350 years) including the Regulatory event. Factors
                        to consider in the assessment include, but not be limited to; frequency of
                        flooding, flooding limits, depth, velocity, V*D product and water surface
                        elevations.
